# Front-end-training
This repository contains some of the projects I have completed during my front-end training

## These Projects are:
1. [PSD-Template-using-flex](https://github.com/mariazayed/Front-end-training/tree/master/PSD-Template-using-flex)<br>
    *The aim of this project is to* convert a photoshop template (PSD template) to a front-end code <br>
2. [Simple-calculator-using-JS](https://github.com/mariazayed/Front-end-training/tree/master/Simple-calculator-using-JS)<br>
    This project is a good practice after learning JavaScript programming language<br>
